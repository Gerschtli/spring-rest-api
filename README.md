# Spring Rest API

It is just an example project of the [getting started guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/) in the spring documentation.

The main purpose of this repository is to play around with spring, maven and how to deploy such a project with nixops.

Deploy with nixops with
```bash
$ git-crypt unlock
$ nixops/manage prod deploy
```
